## An Oasis of Local Journalism and Commentary in the Desert

1912 is Arizona's premier political newsletter, providing its readers with in-depth coverage of the state's political happenings and informed analysis and commentary from elected officials, subject matter experts, and our own experienced analysts. 

**We fill gaps in coverage at the State Capitol and across Arizona, offering a unique blend of straight news and analysis**. 

More than a simple newsletter, we are bringing together people who are dedicated to the ethos of the American West, and the presence of a distinctly Western voice in the national media ecosystem. A voice defined by Arizona and the West's independent spirit; committed to reporting the facts as they are and addressing the contemporary issues we confront.

Due to the nature of frontier life, no strong media institutions were planted in the early West which could reasonably rival the larger papers that occupied the bustling coasts on either side of the nation. Today, Arizona and the Southwest have far more resources, people, and infrastructure, and they are still imbued by the spirit of the West. We are the most dynamic region of the nation in the 21st century, yielding enormous agricultural outputs, producing next generation semiconductors at-scale, building interplanetary rockets, and welcoming inbound migrants from New York to New Delhi.

This surge in population and resources provides Arizona and the West an opportunity to forge a real and independent national voice.

Defined by the same attitude that inspired pioneers to go west, American Indians to build civilizations and thrive despite hardship, and Latinos to cohabitate with their westward neighbors, the time is now for the West to project its voice. This is the future of American journalism – and it may just be the future of America.

## A Phoenix Rising From the Ashes

1912 was born from the challenges and triumphs of the Western Tribune. After facing a devastating cyberattack in January 2023, we saw an opportunity to rise from the ashes, stronger and more focused than ever. Our name, 1912, is a nod to the year Arizona became a state, symbolizing resilience and new beginnings.
